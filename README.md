# House_loan_detection

This project is a part of the Data Science Working Group.

-- Project Status: [Completed]
Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to discuss the house loan classification issue using machine learning algorithms. It is a financial domain study which is also a kind of imbalanced dataset machine learning problem. This study can help bank to detect potential loan loss.


Methods Used
Inferential Statistics
Machine Learning
Data Visualization
Predictive Modeling
Variables selection
Bayes Search

Technologies
Python

Project Description
This project aims to detect potential house loan fraud cases based on historical data. Dataset comes from Kaggle, with over 300 thousand tuples and over 110 features. 

This repository focuses on house loan fraud detection based on XGBoost algorithm. Facing extremely imbalanced dataset, this project applies resample method. Besides, using Boruta variables selection algorithm to select important varibales to reduce dimensions. For hyperparameters tuning issue, this project uses Bayes search algorithm to detect the best set of parameters which will obtain the best ROC score.
